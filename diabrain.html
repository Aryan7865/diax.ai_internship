            <h3>Patterns</h3>
            <p>
              Drugs are prescribed after diagnosis and based on indicators from
              lab reports. A pattern is formed in drug prescriptions for
              ailments on patients by population. Such patterns pave way for
              prescription automation, that is efficient and time saving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CDSS system provides drug prescription help to doctors based
              on patients lab result indicators and vitals information. Doctors
              can consent the drugs, change or remove these recommendations. Add
              in-addition or newly, drugs that are suited for the current
              condition of the patient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such CDSS saves time for doctors who can consult more patients
              effectively. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Detection is analyzing
              patterns in patient data, such as symptoms, lab results, and
              medication history. Healthcare providers can identify potential
              adverse drug reactions or interactions. This information can help
              prevent or minimize harm to patients and improve medication
              safety.

            <h3>Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
              Key insights about ailments can be obtained by analyzing data that
              is saved over a period of time. Intelligence can be applied over
              such data to extract patterns and analyze the effectiveness of the
              drugs prescribed.
            </p>
            <p>
              By applying technologies like machine learning and artificial
              intelligence, we can deduce patterns and take the insight in
              changing the drug models for effective care to patients.
              Currently, for diabetic care, 20 years of patient validated data
              is used to extract insights.

            <p>
              Medical Imaging in AI algorithms can analyze medical images such
              as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to assist in diagnosing diseases and
              conditions. Deep learning algorithms have shown promise in
              detecting abnormalities, assisting radiologists, and improving
              accuracy in image interpretation.

              Integrating both patterns and data-based intelligence makes the
              system robust. Such a system when used by doctors increases their
              efficiency and for patients, it improves the care with a different
              solution approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is preventive and proactive, and a superior system
              helping patients for a long, healthy and happy life.

            <p>
              Technological integration involves connecting and integrating
              various health information systems, electronic health records
              (EHRs), medical devices, and other digital tools to enable
              interoperability and data exchange. This allows for seamless
              sharing of patient information, test results, and treatment plans
              among healthcare providers, improving efficiency and patient
              safety.
